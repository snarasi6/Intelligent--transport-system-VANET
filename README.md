# Intelligent -transport-system-VANET
The main objective is to provide an Intelligent Transport System for the Emergency Medical services using Vehicular Ad–Hoc networks(VANETs).

●	It uses an efficient Re-routing algorithm that re-routes the traffic in the route of the emergency vehicle so that the Emergency vehicle can navigate without having any time delays due to traffic.

●	Simulation of Urban Mobility(SUMO), a simulation tool is used to simulate vehicles and other network components present in a road network.

●	Traffic Control Interface(TraCI) is used to access and manipulate the parameters( Speed,Distance travelled, inter vehicular distance etc...) of the vehicles in a road simulation network. 

●	The Intelligent Transport system reduced the transit time from source to destination of the Emergency vehicle by 25.7% and this paper was presented in the International conference of Advances in Industrial Engineering Applications.

The steps to explore and run this project is given in the Accessibility document in both Phase 1 and Phase 2.
